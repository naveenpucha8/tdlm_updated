walking through shelves packed with documents memorializing north carolina 's past , gov. pat mccrory on tuesday promoted his administration 's effort to modernize the state 's death records .	the governor , his budget director and the health and human services secretary visited the nondescript vital records building to highlight his budget proposal that includes nearly $ 2 million to help create an electronic death records reporting system .	north carolina is just one of four states without such a system , according to officials . "	we 're still in the horse-and-buggy era , " with death records , mccrory said .	the state vital records office processes 83,000 death records annually using a paper-intensive method that can take 90 days to complete a new certificate .	the governor 's group visited two vaults of books containing certificates for those born in north carolina from 1913 to 1935 and death records since the 1980s .	other certificates considered historical are held by the state office of archives and history in paper and on microfilm .	north carolina births have been reported through a paperless system since 2010 .	an electronic system for deaths would make record-keeping more efficient , reduce fraud and respond to citizen requests more quickly , according to mccrory .	an electronic reporting system also could reduce the issuance time to seven days , speeding up end-of-life issues such as wills and benefits . "	it 's the right thing to do toward the citizens and the families to settle their estate , to be able to allow them to move on with the most difficult journey of life , which is death , " health and human services secretary dr. aldona wos said .	the current death report process begins with a funeral director filling out a form and taking it to a physician to sign .	it next goes to the local health department and is ultimately mailed to raleigh before the official recording .	all told , a new reporting system would take nearly four years to build , wos said , and cost more than $ 5 million , requiring money beyond the two year budget being debated .	rep. marilyn avila , r-wake , a house budget writer on health matters , said later tuesday that she and her colleagues have n't looked closely at the request but said the current system 's shortcomings will be weighed with other priorities in the health department .	although the death records system spending wo n't immediately create net savings , the recommendation " just provides better customer service to the citizens of the state , " state budget director lee roberts said .	the department of health and human services also estimates it could save the state 's 2,200 funeral homes at least $ 6.8 million combined in travel time , personnel costs and lost productivity because directors will need less time to locate physicians and transport records around town .	the tour also highlighted mccrory 's push to renovate aging government buildings , particularly in downtown raleigh , and preserve state history .	the early 20th century birth records in the vault have little protecting them beyond a fire suppression system .	and the process of digitizing all records is still way off in the future .

moving on national and lifestyle wires .	@ by wendy koch usa today erin bodmer 's home now has a rain barrel , thanks to a workshop her girl scout troop attended on how to build one . "	we water the plants with the rainwater , " says bodmer , 8 , a bright-eyed third-grader from owings , md. .	she 'll soon be making birdhouses from old coffee cans for her school 's new nature trail , built by a senior girl scout .	welcome to today 's girl scouts of the usa .	while the organization has always strived to create stewards of nature , it 's stepping up its green efforts as it prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary in march 2012 . "	we 're taking it to a new level , " says harriet hessam , the group 's centennial project director .	last year , it published new handbooks , " it 's your planet - love it ! "	that teach girls about the environment , including the negative impact of eating meat and drinking bottled water .	it launched the " girl scouts forever green " project to challenge scouts to save energy and water .	the project , which began in 10 councils and will be expanded nationwide , lets members track their specific accomplishments online .	last year , its participants said they collectively saved 42,000 gallons of water .	the girls also are composting trash at school and learning to do energy audits .	on saturday , bodmer 's troop , along with dozens of others , learned about endangered species and conservation at the national air and space museum 's steven f. udvar-hazy center in chantilly , va. .	on the same day , 3,000 miles away in mill valley , calif. , other girl scouts were removing ice plants along the waterways , because they tend to choke out native plants .	in a 2008 survey , members of the girls scouts picked the environment as the most important issue for them . "	we are where the girls are .	right now , environmental action is very important to them .	we allow them to lead us , " says michelle tompkins , spokeswoman of girl scouts of the usa .	the scouts ' green efforts are playing out in big and small ways : - in massachusetts , as part of " project re-runway , " girls have learned to make outfits using only recycled materials .	- in the washington , d.c. , area , they 've changed 4,276 light bulbs so far , switching from incandescents to more efficient compact fluorescent bulbs , mostly in their own homes .	they 've also distributed donated , reusable grocery bags in the city , which in january began to charge 5 cents for each plastic bag a shopper uses .	- in norridge , ill. , near chicago , joanne dynak , a 15-year-old girl scout , says her troop 's recycling has expanded from aluminum cans to plastic bottles and newspapers , collected at church .	- about an hour southwest of denver , cindy orton says her troop planted 210 trees last year in a forest damaged by the 2002 hayman fire and plans to spend more than $ 600 of its cookie sale profits to plant 420 more this year .	today , the third-graders plan to test how much water the low-flow toilets in their school are saving .	in addition , the girl scouts organization is starting to green its own buildings .	in november in newark , del. , its science and technology lodge became the first building in the state to win the top or platinum rating from the u.s. green building council .	its rooftop solar panels produce 60 percent of its electricity , and its cisterns reuse rainwater for irrigation and toilet flushing .	in san antonio , the sally cheever girl scout leadership center , which opened in 2007 , has two 8,000 gallon cisterns that are used to teach scouts about rainwater harvesting .	the girl scouts also continue to offer nature-oriented camps . "	we believe when they experience nature , they get more involved , " says dana allen , spokeswoman of girl scouts of northern california .	in the san francisco bay area , she says girls learned about watersheds by canoeing .	at the boy scouts of america , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year , spokeswoman renee fairrer says she can not speak to a single new green initiative , because the organization remains as committed as always to helping build and clean up parks and trails . "	while it 's now politically correct to be green , it 's what boy scouts of america has done since its beginning , " fairrer says , citing the boy scouts involvement in recycling , conservation and tree planting efforts .	dynak of illinois , who has been a girl scout since age 5 , says protecting the environment is critical .

south dakota lawmakers are making a last-minute attempt to pass a measure banning texting while driving before the main run of this year 's legislative session ends friday .	the bill was thought to be dead tuesday when a negotiating committee of house and senate members failed to reach agreement .	but the house and senate have appointed new members to the negotiating committee .	rep. charlie hoffman of eureka , chair of the negotiating committee , says he thinks negotiators can reach agreement when it meets thursday .	hoffman says a proposed compromise would make texting while driving a secondary offense , meaning law officers could issue tickets for the offense only after first stopping drivers for other traffic violations .	he says the penalty would start at $ 100 but increase for repeat offenses .
joran van der sloot can be charming , angry , deceitful , tearful .	the young dutchman has been all that and more , playing out his troubled drama on tv over the five years since he came under suspicion in the disappearance of american teenager natalee holloway in aruba .	by his own admission , half of what he says is a lie .	twice arrested and released for lack of evidence in the holloway case , van der sloot was taken into custody again last week in connection with the slaying in peru of stephany flores , a 21-year-old college student police say he met while playing poker at a lima casino .	her may 30 killing came five years to the day after holloway disappeared .	towering over the peruvian officers flanking him , the 6-foot-3-inch dutchman appeared sullen and moist-eyed this weekend when he was paraded before journalists in handcuffs and a bulletproof vest after he was caught and extradited from chile .	chilean police said van der sloot told investigators he was innocent in the case .	he was much more subdued than during his earlier appearances on american and dutch tv , where he has become something of a minor celebrity ?	feeding public curiosity by spinning contradictory stories about holloway 's final hours and sometimes displaying flashes of a volatile temper .	once , at the end of a relaxed interview with dutch crime reporter peter de vries , van der sloot threw a glass of wine in the reporter 's eyes .	aad schalke , a dutch private investigator who administered a polygraph to van der sloot for a tv show about the holloway case aired last year , said he was not surprised the 22-year-old was in trouble again . "	the moment he 's not in control any more , he can be really dangerous , " the detective told the associated press on monday .	van der sloot is the son of a respected lawyer in aruba who died in february .	he was 17 when holloway disappeared in 2005 and he spent three months in detention , then returned to the netherlands to study .	two years later , he was arrested again and sent back to aruba for further questioning .	it 's unclear how he supported himself when he was n't in jail .	he is an avid gambler , and reportedly spent much of the last two years in thailand , where de vries claimed in 2008 van der sloot was recruiting thai women for the sex trade in the netherlands .	just days after the slaying in peru , van der sloot was charged in the united states with trying to extort $ 250,000 from holloway 's family in exchange for disclosing the location of her body and describing how she died .	u.s. prosecutors say $ 15,000 was transferred to a dutch bank account in his name .	van der sloot has told conflicting stories of his involvement with the alabama teen .	he and two surinamese brothers , satish and deepak kalpoe , were the last to see the 18-year-old honors student , who was on a school trip to aruba to celebrate her high school graduation .	he initially told island police he took holloway to her hotel , then later said he left her alive and well on the beach .	he apologized for lying earlier .	at other times he claimed holloway collapsed and died on the beach , and he dumped the body in the ocean .	on another occasion he said her body was taken to a marsh .	in a lengthy 2006 interview with greta van susteren on fox news , van der sloot described drinking shots of rum with holloway , whom he said he met while playing poker at an aruba casino , then taking her to a beach and leaving her there around 3:30 a.m. .	in de vries ' 2008 dutch television documentary , van der sloot said during a secretly recorded conversation that holloway was drunk and slumped to the sand as they were kissing . "	suddenly she started shaking and then she did n't say anything , " van der sloot said in dutch , adding that he did not kill her . "	i would never murder a girl . "	the interview prompted authorities in aruba to reopen the case , but van der sloot later said he made up the whole story and he was not charged . "	i have a busy imagination and it was one big lie .	... nothing 's true , " he told interviewer jaap amesz in a show broadcast on dutch tv last year .	he told amesz yet one more story .	holloway was dancing on a balcony when she accidentally fell over the railing , he said , his eyes filling with tears .	amesz , who had arranged for the polygraph test , asked van der sloot if half of everything he said was a lie . "	oh , more than half , " he replied .	van der sloot 's lie detector test lent support to that admission .	annette heldens , the investigator who questioned van der sloot , said he continuously squirmed in his chair to throw off the polygraph machine . "	he tried to manipulate the results , " she said .	nonetheless , she said the test showed he lied when he repeatedly answered " no , " to questions about whether he was involved in holloway 's disappearance or death .	polygraph tests are inadmissible as evidence in the netherlands , and schalke said police did not follow up after the results were broadcast on tv .	after van der sloot was shown the test results , amesz asked him on camera what he thought the consequences would be .	rather than answer , he grabbed a glass of water from the table , spun out of his chair and smashed it in fury against a wall .
a somali-born teenager plotted " a spectacular show " of terrorism for months , saying he did n't mind that children would die if he bombed a crowded christmas tree-lighting ceremony , according to a law-enforcement official and court documents .	he never got the chance .	mohamed osman mohamud , 19 , was arrested friday in downtown portland after using a cell phone to try to detonate what he thought were explosives in a van , prosecutors said .	it turned out to be a dummy bomb put together by fbi agents , and authorities said the public was never in danger .	the case is the latest in a string of alleged terrorist planning by u.s. citizens or residents , including a times square plot in which a pakistan-born man pleaded guilty earlier this year to trying to set off a car bomb at a busy street corner .	in the portland plot , mohamud believed he was receiving help from a larger ring of jihadists as he communicated with undercover agents , but a law enforcement official who was n't authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on a condition of anonymity told the associated press that no foreign terrorist organization was directing him .	the official said mohamud planned the details , including where to park the van to hurt the most people . "	i want whoever is attending that event to leave , to leave dead or injured , " mohamud said , according to the affidavit .	thousands of people gathered friday on a cold , clear night for the annual event at pioneer courthouse square , a plaza known as " portland 's living room . "	just 10 minutes before mohamud 's 5:40 p.m. arrest , babies were sitting on shoulders , and children cheered at the first appearance of santa claus onstage .	the tree-lighting went off without a hitch .	mohamud graduated from high school in beaverton .	he was enrolled at oregon state university over the past year but withdrawing oct. 6 , the school said .	the law enforcement official who spoke to the ap said agents began investigating mohamud after receiving a tip from someone concerned about him .	the official declined providing further more detail about the relationship between the two .	the fbi monitored mohamud 's e-mail and found he was in contact with people overseas , asking how he could travel to pakistan and join the fight for jihad , according to an fbi affidavit .	the law enforcement official said mohamud e-mailed a friend living in pakistan who had been a student in oregon in 2007-2008 and been in yemen as well .	the e-mail exchanges led the fbi to believe that mohamud 's friend in pakistan " had joined others involved in terrorist activities " and was inviting mohamud to join him , according to the affidavit .	for reasons unexplained , mohamud tried to board a flight to kodiak , alaska , from portland on june 14 , was n't allowed to board and was interviewed by the fbi , the affidavit states .	mohamud told the fbi he wanted to earn money fishing and then travel to join " the brothers . "	he said he had previously hoped to travel to yemen but had never obtained a ticket or a visa .	on june 23 , an agent e-mailed mohamud , pretending to be affiliated with the " unindicted associate . "	the fbi 's affidavit said the friend in pakistan referred him to another associate , but gave him an address mohamud repeatedly tried e-mailing unsuccessfully .	the official said fbi agents saw that as an opportunity and e-mailed in response , claiming to be associates of mohamud 's friend , the former student .	the affidavit said mohamud was warned several times about the seriousness of his plan , that women and children could die , and that he could back out .	but he told agents : " since i was 15 i thought about all this , " and " it 's gon na be a fireworks show ... a spectacular show . "	mohamud , a naturalized u.s. citizen , was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison .	a court appearance was set for monday .	authorities allowed the plot to proceed to build up enough evidence to charge the suspect with attempt .	white house spokesman nick shapiro said saturday that president barack obama was aware of the fbi operation before friday 's arrest .	shapiro said obama was assured that the fbi was in full control of the operation , and the public was not in danger .	authorities said mohamud sent bomb components to undercover fbi agents he believed were assembling the explosive device , but the agents supplied the fake bomb that mohamud tried to detonate twice via his phone .	the fbi affidavit said the undercover agent first met mohamud in person on july 30 and asked what he would do for the cause of jihad , suggesting he might want to spread islam to others , continue studies to help the cause overseas , raise money , become " operational " or become a martyr .	mohamud responded that he wanted to become " operational " but needed training , the affidavit said .	when mohamud was asked what he meant by " operational , " he responded that he wanted to put together an explosion , the affidavit said .	the undercover agent said he could introduce him to an explosives expert and asked mohamud to research potential targets .	at a second meeting on aug. 19 at a portland hotel , the agent brought another undercover agent , the documents said , and mohamud told them he had selected pioneer courthouse square for the bombing .	on nov. 4 , the court documents say , mohamud made a video in the presence of one of the undercover agents , putting on clothes he described as " sheik osama style : " a white robe , red and white headdress , and camouflage jacket .	he read a statement speaking of his dream of bringing " a dark day " on americans and blaming his family for thwarting him , according to the court documents : " to my parents who held me back from jihad in the cause of allah .	i say to them ... if you ?	if you make allies with the enemy , then allah 's power ... will ask you about that on the day of judgment , and nothing that you do can hold me back ... " friday , an agent and mohamud drove to portland in a white van that carried six 55-gallon drums with detonation cords and plastic caps , but all of them were inert , the complaint states .	they left the van near the downtown ceremony site and went to a train station where mohamud was given a cell phone that he thought would blow up the vehicle , according to the complaint .	there was no detonation when he dialed , and when he tried again federal agents and police made their move .	tens of thousands of somalis have resettled in the united states since their country plunged into lawlessness in 1991 , and the u.s. has boosted aid to the country .	in august , the u.s. justice department unsealed an indictment naming 14 people accused of being a deadly pipeline routing money and fighters from the u.s. to al-shabab , an al-qaida affiliated group in mohamud 's native somalia .	fbi agent e.k. wilson said there is no apparent connection between the bomb plot in portland and the investigation he 's overseeing into about 20 men who left minneapolis to join al-shabab in somalia .	officials have been working with muslim leaders across the united states , particularly with the somali community in minnesota , trying to combat the radicalization .	on saturday , omar jamal , first secretary to the somali mission to the united nations and an advocate for somalis in minnesota , said mohamud has a stepmother in minneapolis .	he condemned the plot and urged somalis to cooperate with police and the fbi .	jamal said he had spoken to two somalis who knew mohamud , and he was described as religious and quiet .	jamal said mohamud is from southern somalia . "	everybody 's afraid , really really afraid , " jamal said of members of oregon 's somali communities and elsewhere . "	they 're afraid of , first of all , the label .	the allegation is very serious ... "
and just vanishing can leave you feeling guilty and your provider wondering what went wrong .	here are some better tactics to consider : - put out warning signs .

"	when parting ways with someone who relies heavily on you for income -- such as a live-in nanny or housekeeper -- then warnings are n't enough , she says .	in those cases , " give plenty of notice , " speyer says .

"	a breakup does n't have to be done in person , " speyer says .	but it should n't be done via text message .	it 's too impersonal , and does n't give much room for explanation , she says .	- practice .	( at ) if the decision is to sever ties verbally , then rehearse it . "	preparation is key -- know what you 're going to say ahead of time , " speyer says .	mentally prepare for a variety of different responses , says clinical psychologist maryann troiani . "	there might be extreme reactions " such as anger or begging for another chance .	- be honest and calm .	( at ) " have candor , without being accusatory or hostile , " levine says . "	explain that it 's just not working for you -- you do n't have enough money or you want to try something new .	you do n't need to go into explicit detail .	keep it on a surface level .
